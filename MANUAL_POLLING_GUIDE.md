## New Manual Polling Feature

This document explains how to use the new manual polling functionality added to resolve polling system issues.

## üéØ Quick Fix

If your polling system is not working:

1. **Go to**: WordPress Admin ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí HIC Diagnostics
2. **Find**: "üîÑ Controllo Manuale Polling" section
3. **Click**: "Forza Polling Ora" button (blue button)
4. **Wait**: For the results to appear
5. **Check**: The detailed diagnostics below

## üìã Available Options

### "Forza Polling Ora" (Force Polling Now)
- **When to use**: When polling is completely stuck or not working
- **What it does**: Immediately executes polling, bypassing any locks
- **Best for**: Emergency situations and first-time testing

### "Test Polling (con lock)" (Test Polling with Lock)
- **When to use**: To test normal polling operation
- **What it does**: Executes polling normally, respecting existing locks
- **Best for**: Regular testing and troubleshooting

## üîç Understanding the Diagnostics

### Conditions Section
Each condition must be ‚úÖ (green checkmark) for automatic polling to work:

- **Reliable Polling Enabled**: Must be turned on in settings
- **Connection Type Api**: Must be set to "API Polling" (not webhook)
- **Api Url Configured**: Must have valid Hotel in Cloud API URL
- **Has Credentials**: Must have Basic Auth credentials
- **Basic Auth Complete**: Must have Property ID + Email + Password

### What to Check If Polling Fails

1. **‚ùå Reliable Polling Enabled = No**
   - **Fix**: Go to HIC Settings ‚Üí Enable "Sistema Polling Affidabile"

2. **‚ùå Connection Type Api = No**
   - **Fix**: Go to HIC Settings ‚Üí Set "Tipo Connessione" to "API Polling"

3. **‚ùå Api Url Configured = No**
   - **Fix**: Go to HIC Settings ‚Üí Enter valid "API URL" from Hotel in Cloud

4. **‚ùå Has Credentials = No**
   - **Fix**: Configure Basic Auth credentials:
     - Property ID + Email + Password

### Lock Status
- **üîì No**: Normal, polling can run
- **üîí S√¨**: Another polling process is active
  - If lock is older than 5 minutes, use "Forza Polling Ora"

## üö® Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Il sistema di polling non √® attivo!"
**Solution**: Check all conditions in diagnostics. Usually missing credentials or wrong connection type.

### Issue: Polling works manually but not automatically
**Solution**: 
1. Check if Heartbeat API is working (WordPress feature)
2. Verify all conditions are ‚úÖ in diagnostics
3. Use "Riavvia Sistema Interno" button

### Issue: Lock is stuck (active for >5 minutes)
**Solution**: Use "Forza Polling Ora" to clear the lock and restart polling

### Issue: "Il timestamp √® troppo vecchio (oltre 7 giorni)" - Polling Stops
**Symptoms**:
- Logs show "HTTP 400 - Il timestamp √® troppo vecchio (oltre 7 giorni)"
- Diagnostics show "Polling Continuo (1 min): Mai" and "Deep Check (30 min): Mai"
- Status shows "Prossimo continuo: In attesa di avvio"

**Automatic Solution**: 
The system now includes enhanced timestamp validation that automatically:
- Validates all timestamps before API calls to prevent "too old" errors
- Uses conservative 3-day reset logic (instead of 2-hour) to ensure API compatibility
- Handles edge cases like future timestamps and invalid values
- Provides consistent recovery across all polling functions

Polling should resume within 1-2 minutes after automatic recovery.

**Manual Solution**: 
If automatic recovery doesn't work, use "Forza Polling Ora" to immediately restart the polling system with fresh timestamps.

**Prevention**: 
The new validation system prevents most timestamp errors by ensuring all stored timestamps remain within the API's 7-day limit with a 6-day safety margin.

**Technical Details**: 
This issue occurs when the stored timestamp becomes older than the API's 7-day limit. The fix automatically resets the heartbeat scheduler to restart polling immediately.

## üí° Best Practices

1. **Test First**: Always use "Test Polling" before going live
2. **Check Logs**: Monitor the logs section for detailed error messages
3. **Regular Checks**: Use "Forza Polling Ora" periodically to ensure system health
4. **Monitor Conditions**: Keep an eye on the diagnostics - all should be ‚úÖ

## üìû Getting Help

If polling still doesn't work after following this guide:

1. Take a screenshot of the diagnostic results
2. Check the logs section for error messages
3. Note which conditions show ‚ùå in diagnostics
4. Contact support with this information

The manual polling feature ensures you can always trigger polling immediately, even if the automatic system has issues.
