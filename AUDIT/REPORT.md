# FP HIC Monitor – Audit Report

## Executive Summary
- **3 issues** were recorded: 1 high severity (frontend compliance) and 2 medium severity (build stability & internationalization).
- Impact spans **frontend** (remote asset loading), **build/tooling** (broken demo script), and **internationalization** (hard-coded admin responses).
- No critical security flaws were identified in this pass; remediation can focus on compliance and UX polish.

### Findings by Severity
| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| High     | 1     |
| Medium   | 2     |
| Low      | 0     |
| Critical | 0     |

### Findings by Area
| Area     | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Frontend | 1     |
| Build    | 1     |
| i18n     | 1     |
| Security | 0     |
| Performance | 0  |

## Top Risks
1. **ISS-0002 – Performance dashboard loads Chart.js from external CDN**: violates WordPress guidelines, breaks offline/network-restricted scenarios, and introduces third-party dependency risk.
2. **ISS-0001 – demo-without-enhanced CLI script fatals because namespace is not first statement**: prevents QA/demo automation that relies on the provided CLI showcase.
3. **ISS-0003 – Multiple admin responses and notices bypass translation APIs**: user-facing AJAX responses/notices remain untranslated, blocking proper localization and inconsistent UX.

## Frontend / Backend Flow Review
| Area     | Issue | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Frontend | Performance dashboard depends on CDN-hosted Chart.js. | ⚠️ External dependency blocks rendering when CDN unavailable (ISS-0002). |
| Backend  | No broken flows detected in sampled admin actions beyond untranslated messages. | ✅ No blockers observed. |

## Security Findings
| ID | CWE  | File(s) | Severity |
|----|------|---------|----------|
| –  | –    | –       | –        |

_No direct security vulnerabilities surfaced during this static review._

## Performance Observations
- Relying on a CDN for Chart.js means dashboards stall in restricted or offline environments and adds extra DNS/TLS latency. Bundling locally avoids this overhead (ISS-0002).

## Internationalization
- Numerous admin AJAX responses, notices, and REST errors return hard-coded Italian/English strings (e.g., nonce failures, success messages, wizard alerts, GTM error strings). These need wrapping in translation functions with the `hotel-in-cloud` text domain to comply with WordPress i18n requirements (ISS-0003).

## Assumptions & Unknowns
- WordPress runtime was not executed; findings are based on static analysis and linting.
- Network-dependent behaviours (e.g., remote API reachability) were not validated beyond code inspection.
- Existing automated tests were not run during this audit phase per instructions.
