# Compatibility Audit â€” Phase 6

## Summary
- Added a reusable `hic_for_each_site()` helper that safely switches blog context with `try/finally` to guarantee `restore_current_blog()` runs on PHP 7+ and iterates multisite networks efficiently using ID queries.
- Unified activation bootstrap across single-site and multisite installs so database upgrades, table installation, capability grants, cron cleanup, and log directory provisioning run within each blog's context.
- Extended the `wpmu_new_blog` handler to provision new network sites immediately after creation, ensuring capabilities and database tables are available without manual intervention.

## Validation
- Manual code review of activation and multisite hooks to confirm restored blog context and guarded feature availability.
- Verified no new PHPCS or PHPStan violations are introduced by re-running the existing linters locally.

## Follow-up
- Proceed with the refactoring phase to modularize bootstrap logic now that multisite compatibility guarantees are in place.
