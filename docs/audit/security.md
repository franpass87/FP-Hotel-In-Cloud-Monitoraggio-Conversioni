# Security Hardening Report

## Overview
- Hardened the webhook authentication pipeline by normalizing inbound tokens, enforcing WordPress sanitization, and using constant-time comparisons to prevent subtle bypasses.
- Ensured rate-limiting keys use the sanitized token fingerprint to avoid accidental cache misses across differently encoded inputs.

## Validated Controls
- Reviewed admin AJAX endpoints for nonce verification and capability checks; no additional issues identified.
- Confirmed webhook handler now rejects empty tokens, mismatched encodings, and tokens exceeding the allowed length.

## Next Steps
- Proceed to the performance optimization phase focusing on caching opportunities and heavy queries.
- Monitor runtime logs for any unexpected webhook denials after the stricter normalization to catch misconfigured clients early.
