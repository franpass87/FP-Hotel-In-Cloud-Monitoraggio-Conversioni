# Phase 8 – Test & CI Report

## Test Automation
- Executed `composer test` locally to ensure the full unit test suite passes under the lightweight WordPress stubs shipped with the repository.
- Added defensive guards to `hic_tracking_table_exists()` so WordPress database doubles used in the suite satisfy the relaxed contract without requiring inheritance from the core `wpdb` class.
- Captured the composer-driven coverage command (`php -d auto_prepend_file=tests/preload.php vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-html docs/coverage/html`) output, which currently reports a missing code-coverage driver in this container. When Xdebug or PCOV is available the same command will materialize HTML assets inside `docs/coverage/html`.

## Continuous Integration
- Confirmed the `quality.yml` workflow already runs composer validation, linting, static analysis, and the PHPUnit test suite across PHP 8.1–8.3; no matrix adjustments were required beyond ensuring the test runtime mirrors the local bootstrap.
- Documented the coverage expectations and regeneration steps so GitHub Actions runners with a coverage driver can publish artifacts for release validation.

## Follow-up Actions
- Provision Xdebug or PCOV on the release build agents before invoking the coverage command to generate HTML assets.
- Wire the `docs/coverage/html` directory into release artifacts once coverage can be generated consistently in CI.
