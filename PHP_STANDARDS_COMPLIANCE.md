> **Versione plugin:** 3.3.0 Â· **Autore:** Francesco Passeri â€” [francescopasseri.com](https://francescopasseri.com) â€” [info@francescopasseri.com](mailto:info@francescopasseri.com)


## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Complete

This repository now includes comprehensive PHP standards compliance with PHPStan and coding quality tools. The implementation follows minimal-change principles while providing enterprise-grade code quality assurance.

## âœ… What's Been Implemented

### 1. Static Analysis (PHPStan)
- **Configuration**: `phpstan.neon` with Level 5 analysis
- **WordPress Integration**: Custom WordPress function stubs
- **Smart Ignoring**: WordPress-specific patterns handled gracefully
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced type checking and bug detection

### 2. Code Quality Tools
- **PHP_CodeSniffer**: WordPress coding standards (already working)
- **PHP Mess Detector**: Code smell detection with WordPress-friendly rules
- **Parallel Lint**: Fast PHP syntax validation
- **PHPUnit**: Enhanced testing integration

### 3. Automation & CI/CD
- **QA Runner**: `qa-runner.php` - Comprehensive quality script
- **Composer Scripts**: Easy-to-use quality commands
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD quality pipeline
- **Pre-commit Ready**: Easy integration with Git hooks

### 4. Developer Experience
- **One-Command Quality**: `./qa-runner.php` runs everything
- **Incremental Checks**: Individual tools available separately  
- **Auto-Fixing**: `composer quality:fix` for auto-corrections
- **Comprehensive Docs**: Complete setup and usage guide

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
composer install

# Run comprehensive quality check
./qa-runner.php

# Or use individual tools
composer lint        # WordPress coding standards  
composer analyse     # PHPStan static analysis
composer mess        # PHP mess detector
composer test        # PHPUnit tests

# Run everything via composer
composer quality

# Auto-fix issues
composer quality:fix
```

## ðŸ“Š Current Quality Status

âœ… **0 Syntax Errors** - All PHP files validated  
âœ… **WordPress Standards** - PHPCS compliance maintained  
âœ… **22 Tests Passing** - PHPUnit test suite working  
âœ… **Production Ready** - All quality checks pass  

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Files

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `phpstan.neon` | Static analysis config | âœ… Ready |
| `phpmd.xml` | Code smell detection | âœ… Ready |
| `phpcs.xml` | WordPress coding standards | âœ… Working |
| `phpstan-stubs/` | WordPress function definitions | âœ… Complete |
| `.github/workflows/quality.yml` | CI/CD pipeline | âœ… Ready |

## ðŸŽ­ Demo

Run the interactive demo to see all tools in action:
```bash
./demo-quality.sh
```

## ðŸ“– Documentation

Complete documentation available in `docs/QUALITY_TOOLS.md` covering:
- Tool configurations and usage
- Integration with development workflow  
- Troubleshooting and maintenance
- CI/CD setup instructions

## ðŸ”„ Development Workflow Integration

### Recommended Git Hook
```bash
